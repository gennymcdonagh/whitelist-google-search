Todo/ideas:

- ui for managing whitelist
- checkboxes for selecting urls to apply
- add/remove urls from whitelist
- warn if too many params
- add extra button to google homepage to apply filter
- handle any already included site: params
- disable icon on non google pages
- make it work on any google search url/domain
