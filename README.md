# whitelist-google-search
Chrome extension for managing a whitelist of URLs for filtering Google search results

Todo/ideas:
- better icon with bg colour etc
- ui for managing whitelist
- checkboxes for selecting urls to apply
- add/remove urls from whitelist
- warn if too many params
- add extra button to google homepage to apply filter
- handle any already included site: params
- disable icon on non google pages
